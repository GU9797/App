Upon entering the van, the couples hands were tied with rope, and Richard was clubbed into unconsciousness with a wrench, while one of the perpetrators sexually assaulted Quita.  Quita and Richard were both slashed brutally with a long machete-like blade.  Both were thrown out of the van on the rails of the Southern Pacific tracks, about four and a half miles from Telegraph Hill. Quita was killed by several slashes from the machete-like blade; Richard survived, but was badly mutilated by slashes in his face and he was robbed of his wallet. Two of the perpetrators, Jesse Cooks and Larry Green, were found, charged and in March 1976, convicted for the kidnapping, armed assault, robbery, and murder.  The third perpetrator, Anthony C. Harris, was given immunity at the trial in exchange for his testimony.  The perpetrators were black Muslims who believed in the teachings of the Nation of Islam, and believed that they had to \"destroy the enemy\" and \"kill devils,\" which they translated into meaning, kill whites.  The motives were racist in origins and a response to the racial rhetoric of the time. This was the first incident in a series of 20 attacks (with 23 victims) by the perpetrators who came to be know as the Zebra killers."

As she sped up and reached her front door about to enter, the man approached her with a gun, forced her into a nearby dark parking lot, and raped her in the dirt area behind the bushes. During the incident, he told Linder that racism and oppression of black people needed to stop, and he threatened to kill her and told her that others would also be killed.   Then, he walked Linder home to make sure she would not call the police, and after talking more in her apartment, her raped her a second time in her bedroom. Linder survived and was eventually able to recover from the ordeal. The perpetrator was later identified as Jesse Lee Cooks, one of the eight men who came to be known as the Zebra killers, and this was the second of 20 attacks (with 23 victims) committed by the Zebra murderers, a group of black Muslims who belonged to the Nation of Islam religious sect."

One of the .32 caliber bullets pierced through Wollin's heart, killing him almost instantly.  Wollin was just two blocks from his home.  This incident occurred just a few minutes after the murder of white woman Tana Smith a few streets away.  No indictment other than the charge of conspiracy was brought on this crime, but authorities believe that J.C. Simon and Manuel Moore were responsible for the murder of Wollin, as witness Anthony Harris described.  The perpetrators were black Muslims who believed in the teachings of the Nation of Islam, and believed that they had to \"destroy the enemy\" and \"kill devils,\" which they translated into meaning, kill whites.  The motives were racist in origins and a response to the racial rhetoric of the time.  This was the thirteenth in a series of 20 attacks (with 23 victims) on random whites by black Muslims who came to be known as the Zebra Killers, and specifically, the second of 5 attacks on this day."

She responded with the same and then started up the stairs, at which point the man shot McMillian in the back two times with a .32 caliber gun; the first shot passed through her body, and the second hit her spine, paralyzing her from the waist down as she collapsed to the floor.  McMillian survived the attack, but was left paralyzed for the rest of her life.  She was the only one of the Zebra killers' five victims on this night in late January that survived.

His decision was met with fights between black and white students at the high school, and opposition and anger from many school officials and political leaders in Boston who denounced his orders and his lack of acknowledgement of faculty efforts to implement his desegregation requirements."

The explosion occurred in the second-floor probation office and caused severe damage including a 10-foot hole in the floor, windows shattered and damage to the outside brick wall, but no casualties resulted from this incident.  The bombing is linked to the an explosive attack on the Dorchester Army National Guard in Boston as well as the destruction of an airliner at Logan International Airport on the same day (197607020008, 197607020009) and also the bombing of a post office in Seabrook, New Hampshire (197607020007).  In October 1976, Everett C. Carlson was convicted and sentenced to ten years in prison for transporting explosives in the three attacks as was Richard J. Picariello in February 1977, and in March 1977, Edward P. Gullion was also convicted and awaiting sentencing; Joseph Aceto was also responsible for the attacks and pleaded guilty in September 1976 and subsequently became a government witness in the later trials."

Additionally, a written message was taped to a telephone booth at 53rd Street and Fifth Avenue, about a block away from the hotel, in which FALN stated that the blast was an attempt to protest the appearance of Rafael Hernandez Colon, the Governor of Puerto Rico, who was attending a political fund-raising dinner on the second floor of the hotel to raise funds for his re-election.  The bombing caused minor damage to the hotel, but there were no casualties in the blast."

Cikoja was on his way to his own car, when he collapsed on the front stoop.  Croatian nationalists are suspected to be responsible for the incident because Cikoja had received a threat letter , three months prior to his murder, from a group calling itself the \"Croatian Nationalist Army\", demanding that he pay $5,000 by August towards the group's cause for independence, or otherwise he would be killed. He refused to pay the money.  At least fifteen other Yugoslav immigrants in the metropolitan area had received similar letters."

Earlier this day, Whitfield preached for three hours on the steps of the Cullman County courthouse, at which time he denounced the conviction, and was taunted by whites.

In the book, there were three batteries and what appeared to be dynamite in a hollowed out section.  While disarming the device, detective George Timm lost part of his right index finger, and suffered cuts on his hand, face, and chest.

During the march, Klansmen blocked the street, disobeyed police orders to allow the marchers to pass, and opened gunfire, injuring two black marchers and five law enforcements officials.  Two Klansmen were also shot and wounded. In May 1984, ten Klansmen were charged in federal court for civil rights violations in a violent disruption of black marchers and police, and nine of the men were charged with the conspiracy of use of force or threat of force for purposes of intimidating parade participants because of their race. By January 1989, all ten Klan members had either been found guilty or pleaded guilty to the charges brought against them in this incident."

Additionally, the explosion destroyed the side wall of the agency, causing extensive damage, and also damaged a jewelry store on the first floor and the apartment of an elderly couple on the third floor.  Less than an hour after the blast, a man called the Associated Press and a local TV station, claiming bombing and identifying himself as a member of the Croatian Freedom Fighters.  He also stated that a message was left in a locker at the terminal at 421 Grand Central Station.  The message was written in Croatian and listed a series of demands that the group asked be aired on television and radio between 6pm and 7pm that evening, otherwise 2 more bombs, which were placed in congested areas, would be detonated at 8:30pm that evening. The group's message, which denounced  the Yugoslav Secret Police, and asked that the U.S. stop economic aid to Yugoslavia  and that political and economic ties to Yugoslavia by the U.S. and West Germany be broken, was aired, and no other bombs were detonated."

The ambush left one serviceman slightly injured by broken glass which lightly grazed him.  The vehicle, which had no government markings, had just left the Las Americas expressway at an exit about one mile from the University of Puerto Rico, where three to four men were hiding under an underpass.  One perpetrator jumped out and opened fire on the government vehicle with a rifle, leaving 11 bullet holes in the vehicle.  This was the second attack against US military personnel in Puerto Rico in four months but it is unclear whether this attack was linked to the December attack of a Navy Bus as that incident was claimed by three different Puerto Rican nationalist groups."

Four children, ranging in ages from 6 years old to 15 years old, and their uncle were in the home when the lighted gasoline firebomb bounced off of the arm of the 6-year old girl and exploded, setting the home on fire.

Though authorities believe that this incident had no involvement from the Ku Klux Klan, it occurred three weeks after the  Klan held its first public rally in the state in more than 70 years.  However, the bombing was intended to intimidate the family and other black families in the area, and infringe upon the family's housing rights. Charles N. Metheny and Eugene R.

However, they shot Blacks at random, not specifically the people who attacked them.  This attack occurred at a time when racial tensions were volatile in Youngstown, and violence against blacks across the nation in general was increasing, as was activity by the Ku Klux Klan, which lead to the perception of a conspiracy against blacks.

Conteh was an immigrant who had been in the United States for 10 years, but neighbors said he was attempting to organize a branch of the Sierra Leone Peoples Party in opposition of the current president of Sierra Leone, Siaka Stevens.  The motivations of this incident were unclear, but police confirmed that it was not a robbery."

During the incident, Kholya held hostage the 21 other passengers and crew members on the plane, and only released them after diverting the plane to land in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, once Kholya made a deal with Mexican officials for a plane ticket to Cuba in exchange for the release of the passengers.  All the hostages were released unharmed.  Kholya's motivation for hijacking the plane was because he was opposed to U.S. policy towards Iran and he wanted to make Americans aware of the conditions in Iran."

No casualties resulted from the attack; however, the blast caused shattered windows and frames, and damage to air conditioners and ceiling as well as minor damage to the U.S. Department of Agriculture nearby.

The Macheteros claimed responsibility for the attack in a phone call to the Associated Press in San Juan, at which time the caller expressed the group's support for the people of Grenada and opposition towards the US for the invasion of Grenada. Additionally, the group left communiqués which stated the blast was in protest of the policies of the U.S. and Ronald Reagan, who the Macheteros claim, took advantage of the people of Grenada to reestablish imperialism."

Sprogis, and American citizen, was a former police chief in Nazi-occupied Latvia during World War II, and had been previously been accused of war crimes, but in deportation proceedings, all charges against him were dismissed.  At the time of the incident, it is suspected that a fire was set at Sprogis' home in order to have him evacuate the home via the front door, where an explosive was planted on his front steps.  Sprogis' neighbor Robert Seifried, saw the fire, and went to alert Sprogis, but inadvertently set off the bomb (meant for Sprogis), resulting in serious burns to his Seifried's right foot, leg and shoulder.  Damage to the home included shattered windows, destroyed aluminum siding, and other minor damage.  After the incident, two calls were made to Newsday newspaper from an unknown male, stating \"Listen carefully, Jewish Defense League, Nazi war criminal. Bomb. Never again.\"  Though the JDL denied involvement in the incident, authorities believe the group was responsible."

The two were trying to cut down the power line using a propane torch, similar to their previous incidents of terrorism in 1987 and 1988 at the Flagstaff, Arizona ski lifts and the power lines at the Grand Canyon, Arizona.  The power pole was owned by the U.S. Department of Energy, and the Harcuvar Substation owned by the Central Arizona Project (CAP), which was the main source of water supply for Arizona.  The perpetrators were arrested as they were at the location, about to carry out the attack, and thus, authorities believe much potential damage to the substation was prevented."

The incident caused more than $200,000 in damage.  There were no casualties reported in the incident. This is similar to another incident on the same day in which ALF members cut coyote pens and set fire to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Predator Ecology Project field station in Millville, Utah (102492), just a few miles away.  Both incidents were claimed by ALF in an unsigned press release sent by fax to The Moscow-Pullman Daily News in Moscow, Idaho, stating that the raids were meant to slow the   genocidal war'' against native wildlife, and the actions of the group were \"nonviolent acts of self-defense on behalf of free and imprisoned coyotes everywhere.''  ALF member, Rodney Coronado, who launched \"Operation Bite Back\" in 1991, a five-state arson campaign against the fur industry, was later captured and indicted on federal charges for these incidents.  He did not act alone, but the other perpetrators are unknown. Coronado spent three and a half years in prison for fur industry arsons."

All six bombs exploded, causing $1,000,000 in property damage.  There were no casualties in the incident, and none of the 800 mink in the building were harmed. The same day, a caller phoned the KSL radio station, claiming responsibility for the incident in the name of ALF, and a second call was made to Coalition to Abolish the Fur Trade, also claiming the incident in the name of animal rights activists, but there was no specific reference to a person or group.  The perpetrators, Alexander David Slack, Clinton Colby Ellerman, Douglas Joshua Ellerman, Sean Albert Gautschy,  Adam Troy Peace, and Andrew Bishop, were arrested and indicted for their involvement in the incident and an alleged earlier attempt to bomb the co-op, which was aborted when they saw police presence.  After a trial, Sean Albert Gautschy,  Adam Troy Peace, and Andrew Bishop were acquitted, while Clinton Ellerman was sentenced to 5 years in prison, Douglas Ellerman to 7 years (which was later reduced by 13 months); Slack committed suicide months prior to the trial."
