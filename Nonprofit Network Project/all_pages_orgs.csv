The potential march was a powerful motivator for the survivors, who had seen similar demonstrations leading up to the very atrocities they experienced years before.   Many spoke out about their experiences for the first time as they began to recognize the importance of teaching others about the lessons of the Holocaust and the dangers of unchallenged hate.  For nearly three decades since, the survivors and their organization provided educational programming to school and community groups from a small storefront Museum located in Skokie."

CASL began in 1978 as a one-woman operation in the back office of a Chinatown dental practice.  Soon the community began to accept CASL's services and a 700-square-foot building was rented.

In 2004 CASL built its own facility and moved into its current site. The 37000-square-foot Kam L. Liu building consolidated all of the sites into one convenient modern facility. CASL has grown to become the largest and most comprehensive community-based social service agency in the Midwest dedicated to the needs of Chinese Americans serving over 17000 clients each year.

Named the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle (UICC), the new campus opened in February 1965. Unlike the Navy Pier campus, Circle was a degree-granting institution, with ambitions to become a great university.

It is estimated that about one in four American adults meets a minimal standard of civic scientific literacy.

We worked with tenants to help them organize a series of meetings, do door-to-door outreach, and lead a campaign to stop the demolition?winning a public commitment from the owners to preserve the complex. Through this victory, the organization grew as we realized the need for a multi-issue community organization to struggle to preserve housing throughout the area, fight for healthcare and jobs, and improve juvenile justice. Our base has grown to include over 1,200 tenants from 3 complexes and 800 homeowners, youth, mental health patients, homeless and unemployed people, and community allies."

To address this need The Childrenâs Place Association opened the Midwestâs first residential facility dedicated to the care of HIV/AIDS-affected children.
